-Gossip Protocol is a communication protocol, it is process computer to computer communication that works on the same principle as how information is shared on social networks.
-The Gossip protocol is used to repair the problems caused by multicasting; it is a type of communication where a piece of information or gossip in this scenario, is sent from one or more nodes to a set of other nodes in a network.
-This is useful when a group of clients in the network require the same data at the same time. But there are many problems that occur during multicasting, if there are many nodes present at the recipient end, latency increases; the average time for a receiver to receive a multicast.
-To get this multicast message or gossip across the desired targets in the group, the gossip protocol sends out the gossip periodically to random nodes in the network, once a random node receives the gossip, it is said to be infected due to the gossip.
-Now the random node that receives the gossip does the same thing as the sender, it sends multiple copies of the gossip to random targets. This process continues until the target nodes get the multicast. This process turns the infected nodes to uninfected nodes after sending the gossip out to random nodes.
