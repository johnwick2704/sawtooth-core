-The journal is a group of validator subcomponents that work together to handle batches and proposed blocks.
-Responsible for completing published blocks, publishing batches into blocks to extend the chain, and validating proposed blocks to determine if they should be considered for the new chain head.

->The Completer initially receives the blocks and batches. It guarantees that all dependencies for the blocks and batches have been satisfied.
->Completed batches go to the BlockPublisher for batch validation and inclusion in a block.
->Completed blocks go to the ChainController for block validation and fork resolution.
->The BlockCache and BlockStore provide storage for the batches and blocks being processed.
